# Valorant Champions - Character Pickrate Dashboard.
## Problem Statement
Valorant Champions was one of the biggest esports tournaments of all time. In order to better my understanding of the dominant storylines of the game, it is vital to see overall agent pickrate. Furthermore, having the flexibility to see how  this pickrate broke down across maps and across teams could highlight some other interesting insights that could prompt further analysis.

The technical purpose of this exercise is to acquaint myself with available data for Valorant (scraping, APIs etc.) as well as develop a repeatable pipeline to reproduce this analysis across different tournaments. I also want to learn how to deploy the app.

## Planned Approach
1. Start by identifying the most reliable source for data on champion pickrates for this specific tournament. 
2. Ensure that you can safely access this data on a repeatable basis (legal, safe, consistent etc.)
3. Write the Python code to import the data. Optimize the code by using AI tools to analyze your writing and identify weakpoints
4. Clean the code as necessary after import.
5. Identify the most effective dashboarding tool to create and present this data, ensuring that you are able to host it for public consumption
6. Sketch out a planned format 
7. Build the dashboard, using all educational resources to help you resolve issues
